The TV Guide is a program the allows users to view the schdeules of any channel of their choosing by just simply inputting any of the pre-determined channel numbers available.





Here's a breakdown of how the program works:
1. The user is required to enter the channel number of any of the channels displayed below:
    1. XB News
    2. Blue Ocean
    3. SoundTrack
    4. Rebel Music
    5. Rosemary
    6. One Action
    7. Vue Sports X
    8. MovieMax More
    9. Foschia
    10. Mizu
    11. Rave TV
    12. Sparkle
    13. 13th Street
  
    NOTICE: These channels are not real and were completely made up for the sake of this project. Additionally, these channels do not belong to a specific television or media operator.

2. As soon as the user enters their desired channel number, a small and short schedule that details the time at which shows are starting is automically displayed.
   It is accomplished with the help of procedures that store the schedules for each and every channel. There's one procedure for each channel's schedule available in the program.
   The reason why procedures were used was to increase the simplicity of the program as well as make it easier and more understandable. The schedule should look something like this:
    |----MONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2015----|
    08:45 pm - News at 8
    09:00 pm - The Asian Perspective
    09:30 pm - The Asian Perspective
    10:00 pm - Byte This

   This is more like a concept of a TV Guide program. It's an easy and simple representation of a TV guide's basic features. I'm currently working on a more advanced TV Guide which should be completed by the end of this month.
